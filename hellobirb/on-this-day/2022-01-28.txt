Oh, so many observances today!

• It's **National Daisy Day**, so go get yourself a flower. :blossom:
• It's **National Fun at Work Day**, which is obviously a joke.
• It's **National Kazoo Day**, which sounds like something you might be forced to endure during National Fun at Work Day.
• It's **National Lego Day**, so celebrate your love of the Danish blocks by taking off your shoes and doing a dance on a bed of bricks.
• It's **National Blueberry Pancake Day**! :blueberries::pancakes: My favorite! I have seen <@!501126028723486726> make blueberry chocolate chip pancakes, because he is 12 years old, but swears it is really good.
• It's **National Data Privacy Day**, so—actually, I'm not going to say any more. :unamused:

• And lastly, but most importantly, it's **Día Nacional <@!804505913959907349> viaja a México**. :airplane_departure::flag_mx: :beach_umbrella::woman_surfing::tropical_drink: Hermosa mujer, corazón abierto de par en par, bathe in the light, feed your soul.
