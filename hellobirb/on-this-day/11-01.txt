Today celebrates food! It's **National Calzone Day** :yum:, **National Vegan Day** :salad:, **National Vinegar Day**, **National Cook For Your Pets Day** (especially birbs!), and **National Deep Fried Clams Day**. We're getting really specific with that last one, but Big Clam demands representation, I guess.
