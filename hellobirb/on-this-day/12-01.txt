Today is **National Peppermint Bark Day**! Crunchy, pepperminty, and white chocolate silky, I want it _now!_ Be sure to clean your teeth up afterward with nature's own candy, because it is **Eat a Red Apple Day**! Pick a good one, though, no bullshit Red Delicious, capisce? :unamused::apple: 

It's also—get this, "National Package Protection Day," a day that "seeks to encourage consumers across the US to become more mindful about the packages they order during the holiday season." Hey, **Ring LLC**, we see you and your centralized police state dreams back there propping up this sock puppet of an observance. Get bent, assholes! :face_with_symbols_over_mouth::middle_finger::bird: But also, I hear that package stealing is bad and completely violates the spirit of the holidays, so, be aware of that too, I suppose. :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

Rounding out today's National Days on a more pleasant note, it's **National Christmas Lights Day**! String up your colorful electrified seasonal baubles and bathe in their comforting glow. It'll feel so good you'll smile like one of those way-too-happy clip art models. But you know where there's going to be a real nestload of comforting Christmas glow? At Rockefeller Center in New York City, where the tree lighting ceremony—an event dating back to 1933—will happen tonight. :christmas_tree::relaxed:
