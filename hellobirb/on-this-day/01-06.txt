Awwww, it's **National Cuddle Up Day**! Alas, I can't understand this too well because birb has been living a rough and tumble lifestyle for too long, never getting too close to anyone or anything. Not a lot of cuddling when you're bouncing around from town to town taking on odd jobs just to make a few bucks to keep going, never sure what the next roadhouse holds in store for you. But it sounds nice. A birb can dream.

If you're going to cuddle up, though, you should know it's also **National Bean Day**. So be aware, and make good choices. :peach::dash::mask:
