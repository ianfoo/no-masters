Today is **National Pastry Day**. So someone please bring me a twice-baked chocolate croissant. I mean, get yourself one, too. But it would be nice if someone brought birb something sometime. When you deliver it, though, we will _get down_ because it's also **National Techno Day**, by which I mean the music and not that vile "technology" stuff that so many of you spend all your time with. It's also **International Anti-Corruption Day**, but honestly, pastries and techno music seem so much more appealing, and you do _**not**_ want to get me started on corruption. :bricks::fire:
