Today is **National Ugly Sweater Day**, **National Device Appreciation Day** :mobile_phone:, and **National Maple Syrup Day**. :maple_leaf: This is super convenient, because a great way to make a sweater ugly is to pour _maple syrup_ all over it; and I can think of no better way to give your computers and phones the appreciation they deserve than by covering them with a thick layer of maple syrup.
