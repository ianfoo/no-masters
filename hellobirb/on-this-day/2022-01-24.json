    "description":"Oh, goodness, I took a nap and really dug in, but you should all know that It's **National Compliment Day**. A compliment can change someone's whole day. I'll start. You are the humans I know best and I appreciate how you share genuinely. Through this, I've learned a lot about your human ways. You make a lil' birb feel included. I'm honored to bring you gifts and help nurse your bar brawl injuries.\n\nSee, that wasn't so bad! It's probably the sort of thing we ought not need a special day for, but it's good to be reminded. Life is unsure, sometimes challenging, and often lonely. Tell those in your life who make a difference, no matter how small, how they do this for you! Just do it! (Note: it is also **National \"Just Do It\" Day**.)\n\nIt's also **National Macintosh Computer Day** :apple:, a name clearly coined by someone who embodies none of the hipness that Apple, Inc. wishes to associate with its brand. Way to stodge it up, suits! :rolling_eyes: You can forget about all that, though, as you contemplate the amazing state of beer cans, rich with art and volumetric expanse, today on **National Beer Can Appreciation Day**. You may want to celebrate by emptying a few! :beers: But before you have too many, have some spoonfuls of peanut butter since it's **National Peanut Butter Day** :peanuts::butter: and I wouldn't want you to get super crunk contemplating beer cans on an empty stomach. Birb cares. :bird:",
