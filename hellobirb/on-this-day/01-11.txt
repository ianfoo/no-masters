It's **National Clean Off Your Desk Day**, so clean up that bomb test site you call a desk. By end of day, I want it looking like the photos you'd find on a Pinterest board of hipster designers' desks that are beautiful to look at and bereft of everything except a wireless Apple keyboard and Magic Touchpad, with a beautiful chair that in no way would be suitable to sit at for any extended period of time.

It's also **National Parity at Work Day**, so adjust your modem settings accordingly to 7E1, just for today, as a treat.
