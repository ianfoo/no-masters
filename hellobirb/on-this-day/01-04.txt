It's **National Trivia Day**! "Trivia," as a word, means "insignificant," or "of little importance," but back before around 2020 it was also a colloquialism for an event that lots of people used to take part in, to test their knowledge answering questions in a variety of topics while competing against other teams; to gather with others; and to drink beer and eat bar food early in the week. A birdie told me that some of you used to do this! Some form of trivia lived on for a short while in the virtual domain, once the pando displaced everyone from bars, but these events dried up once everyone got tired of the pandemic and decided they weren't about that life anymore.

I still believe in a future that sees the return of "trivia." You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.
