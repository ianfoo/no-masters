Today is **National Brownie Day**. So, find yourself a brownie and chow down. Just make sure it's not one of those cake-like brownies. What the hell is that nonsense? Now, avert your gaze while I demolish this fudgy treat. Or alternatively, participate in today's other observance **Pretend to be A Time Traveler Day** and just skip to when I've finished. Because this isn't going to be pretty.
