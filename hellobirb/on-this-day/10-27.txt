Today is **National American Beer Day**! Drink yourself a nice *American* beer. :flag_us: :statue_of_liberty: And I don't mean that macro swill. And nothing owned by AB InBev, either, unless you don't mind bringing shame to your family. :person_shrugging: Chug-a-lug! :beers:

It's also **National Black Cat Day** :black_cat: and **Cranky Co-Workers Day** :angry:, that last one being one that *some* people observe a lot more often than annually. :unamused:
