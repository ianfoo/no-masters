It's the **National Great American Smokeout**! So puff down! No, wait, I misunderstood. This is a day to _stop_ cigarette smoking! A break of at least 24 hours to help start on the road to recovery. And if you don't smoke, support those who are trying to quit! Whether or not you're trying to quit, we can all happily celebrate **World Toilet Day**, which is also today! What would we do without toilets? Just picture it. Cesspools everywhere, goodness. :toilet:
