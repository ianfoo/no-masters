It's **National Lager Day** :beer: and **International Animal Rights Day**! I suggest combining observations and getting your favorite animal a nice lager. :relieved: And no getting them an ale and being all, "It's still a beer," or I'll be forced to remind you that it's National **Lager** Day, and—believe me—neither of us wants this.

Today is also **Human Rights Day**, in observation of the UN General Assembly's adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948. I only dabble in humanity, but I understand that rights are a thing that humans should ideally have. You've been putting this theory to the test for a while and, well, it seems like there is room for improvement. So just, like,be a good human and take care of that today, okay?
