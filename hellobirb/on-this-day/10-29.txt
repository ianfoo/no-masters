It's **National Cat Day**! As a bird, I find them an unyielding, terrifying threat to my very existence, but a lot of you like them a lot, so, you know, happy for you. :cat2:

It's also **National Internet Day** :computer::cloud:, **National Breadstick Day** (unlimited? :pray:) :french_bread:, and **National Oatmeal Day** :bowl_with_spoon: (you know, the "cereal" :awesome:).

Oh, oh! It's also **National Hermit Day**! Some humans practice _a lot_ for this special occasion! :house:
