Ooh. Ooh! Are you ready for this?

It's **NATIONAL BIRD DAY**. Yeah. BIRBS REPRESENT! Big ones, small ones, long ones, short ones, skinny ones, and perfectly spherical ones. We are loud and proud. Well, we are at least proud. Only some of us are loud.

I shall be accepting tribute on this most hallowed of days, to be donated to **Birbs Without Borders** and **Feed the Birbs**. `TheBirbIsTheWord` on Venmo or `$BirbyBirbBirb` on Cash App!
