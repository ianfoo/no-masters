Ooh. Ooh! Are you ready for this?

It's **NATIONAL BIRD DAY**. Yeah. BIRBS REPRESENT! Big ones, small ones, long ones, short ones, skinny ones, and _perfectly spherical_ ones. We are loud and proud. Well, we are at least proud. Only some of us are loud.

I shall be accepting tribute on this most hallowed of days. You can Venmo `Hello-Birb` (`$BIRB` on Cash App) if that works better for you, too!
