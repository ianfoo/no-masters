Today is **Bill of Rights Day**, so go assemble, speak freely (aside from being a witness against yourself), and do not allow soldiers to quarter in your home. There are already more firearms than Americans, so don't feel like you need to go out and buy one.

Oddly, cupcakes are _not_ protected in the first ten amendments, but take heart, because it is **National Cupcake Day**. :cupcake: Curiously, it is also **Lemon Cupcake Day** :lemon:, and I am unclear about the redundancy here.

Follow your cupcake with a nice cuppa, because it is **International Tea Day**! :tea: For the Americans, tea is a beverage enjoyed elsewhere in the world.

Once you're rightly fortified with tea and cupcakes, and empowered by your federally-granted rights, you'll be properly prepared to deal with the agents of chaos who seek to unravel your day at every turn, because indeed, it is **National Cat Herders Day**. :pouting_cat: You, who deal with all this with any degree of success, are a champion amongst mortals.
